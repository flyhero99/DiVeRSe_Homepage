								Question: Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. If Raymond has 40 jewels, how many jewels does Siobhan have?
								Self: Aaron has 2 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So Aaron has 40 / 2 + 2 = <<40/2+2=22 >> 22 jewels%% Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron so she has 22 - 2 = <<22-2=20 >> 20 jewels%% #### 20
								Cross: Raymond has 40 jewels.%% Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2=<<40/2=20 >> 20%% Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, so he has 20+5=<<20+5=25 >> 25 jewels.%% Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, so she has 25-2=<<25-2=23 >> 23 jewels.%% #### 23

								Q: There are twice as many boys as girls at Dr. Wertz's school. If there are 60 girls and 5 students to every teacher, how many teachers are there?
								Self: There are 120 boys at Dr. Wertz's school.%% There are 60 + 120 = <<60+120=180 >> 180 students total.%% There are 180 / 5 = <<180/5=36 >> 36 students per teacher.%% Thus, there are 180 / 36 = <<180/36=5 >> 5 teachers.%% #### 5
								Cross: The number of boys is 2*60=<<2*60=120 >> 120%% There are 60+120=<<60+120=180 >> 180 students total%% Each teacher has 5 students, so 180/5=<<180/5=36 >> 36 teachers%% #### 36

								<p>Then they lost w-8 games.</p>
								<p>So they played w + (w-8) games.</p>
								<p>w + (w-8) = 22.</p>
