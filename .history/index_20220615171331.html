								<h2>Question</h2>
								<p>Ali is a dean of a private school where he teaches one class. John is also a dean of a public school. John has two classes in his school. Each class has 1/8 the capacity of Ali’s class which has the capacity of 120 students. What is the combined capacity of both schools?</p>
								<h2>Answer</h2>
								<p>Ali’s class has a capacity of 120 students.<br />Each of John’s classes has a capacity of 120/8 = 15 students.<br />The total capacity of John’s two classes is 15 students * 2 classes = 30 students.<br />The combined capacity of the two schools is 120 students + 30 students = 150 students.</p>
